### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate **AI enthusiast** and **Software Developer** with a love for tackling complex problems through code. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the **University of Padua**, where I focused my research on **AI security** and **machine learning**. My thesis explored vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) through poisoned vector databases in RAG-based systems, and I've since worked on projects across machine learning, data analysis, and full-stack development.
