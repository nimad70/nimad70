# üëã Hello, I'm Nima!

I'm an **Artificial Intelligence enthusiast** and **Software Developer** with a passion for solving complex problems through code. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Padua, I've focused my academic journey on **AI security** and **machine learning** innovation. Recently, I worked on exposing vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) using poisoned vector databases in RAG-based systems as part of my thesis. My journey has taken me from freelance projects to research internships, always driven by a love for pushing the boundaries of technology.
